# LOCeating_AssociationRulesMining
This project used data compiled across multiple studies to identify characteristics associated with loss of control (LOC)-eating in children. A data-driven approach called association rules mining (ARM) was used to generate clusters of characteristics that are associated with LOC-eating.

## Primary Publication
These data have now been published in Appetite:
Pearce, A. L., Brick, T. R., Masterson, T., Adise, S., Fearnbach, S. N., Stein, W., English, L., Tanofsky-Kraff, M., & Keller, K. L. (2021). Using association rules mining to characterize loss of control eating in childhood. Appetite, 163, 105236. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105236

A perminant link for the publications data and procedures is registered through Open Science Framework (10.17605/OSF.IO/BJ8ZA) with web link: https://osf.io/bj8za/. 

## Disclaimers
These scripts are not guaranteed to work for new data or under new directory configurations, however, they should work if downloaded with the data and no changes are made to directories. To use these scripts R/Rstudio and all package librarys are required. I completed this project prior to learning about renv so exact replication of results is not gaurenteed as both R and package versions may differ.

## Directory Structure

-Data: publically available, de-identified data is available on the Open Science Framework (10.17605/OSF.IO/BJ8ZA) only

-ResultsOutput: .csv files for the resulting rules

-LOC_Figs: figures generated by the .Rmd file

-Primary Directory: contains all scripts
  1) LOCeating_ARM.Rproj - the Project file used to analyze data
  2) LOC_ARules_setup_CascadeApproach.R - processes and cleans data; also creates a dataset with no duplicates (takes first visit only if there were multiple)
  3) LOC_Analyses_CascadeApproach.R - contains all the analysis code
  4) LOC_ARules_CascadeApproach.Rmd - markdown file that will source the analysis script and produce a .pdf summary of results
  5) LOC_ARules_CascadeApproach.pdf - .pdf summary of results
  6) functions.R - a misc. set of custom functions (not all are relevant for this project)
  7) ARM_ORconf.R - a script to calcuate the confidence intervals of the odds ratios provided by arules
  8) CleanData.R - a script to prepare raw data; note - the full raw data is not publically available, but this will show initial processing steps
